## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

Create a `.env` file in the backend folder with the following content:
```env
MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-uri>
```
The MongoDB URI (username and password) is confidential. Use your own credentials.

Start the backend server:
```bash
node server.js
```
The server will run on http://localhost:5000.

### Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend folder:
```bash
cd ../frontend
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the frontend folder with the following content:
```env
